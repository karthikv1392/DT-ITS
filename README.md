# Traffic Simulation and Digital Twin

This project demonstrates a **real-time traffic simulation** integrated with **machine learning-based predictions** and **dynamic actuation**. The application simulates vehicle movements on a road, predicts traffic conditions near a traffic light, and dynamically controls the light state to optimize traffic flow. The design follows a modular **Digital Twin** architecture, separating simulation components, predictive modeling, and orchestration logic.

## Features

### 1. **Traffic Simulation**
- Simulates vehicles moving along a straight road.
- Incorporates characteristics like speed and position for each vehicle.
- Dynamically counts vehicles near the traffic light.

### 2. **Traffic Prediction**
- Uses a **Linear Regression model** trained dynamically during the simulation.
- Predicts the number of vehicles near the traffic light at future time steps.

### 3. **Dynamic Actuation**
- Traffic light state (`RED` or `GREEN`) is controlled in real-time based on predicted traffic conditions.
- Implements rules to optimize traffic flow, e.g., turning green when a predicted threshold is exceeded.

### 4. **Modular Design**
- Separation of concerns with **Vehicle**, **Traffic Light**, **Road**, and **Prediction Model** components.

## Architecture Overview

### **Modular Components**

1. **Vehicle Model (`vehicle.py`)**
   - Represents individual vehicles with position and speed characteristics.
   - Handles movement logic based on traffic light state.

2. **Traffic Light Model (`traffic_light.py`)**
   - Manages traffic light state (`RED` or `GREEN`) and timing rules.
   - Updates state based on a configurable cycle duration.

3. **Road Model (`road.py`)**
   - Represents the road and manages all vehicles.
   - Handles vehicle interactions with the traffic light and counts vehicles near it.

4. **Prediction Model (`model.py`)**
   - Trains a Linear Regression model during simulation.
   - Predicts future vehicle counts near the traffic light for dynamic actuation.

5. **Main Script (`traffic_simulation_app.py`)**
   - Orchestrates simulation, prediction, and visualization.
   - Integrates all components for a complete Digital Twin experience.

## Application Workflow

1. **Simulation**:
   - Vehicles move dynamically along a road, respecting traffic light states.
   - The simulation collects data on vehicle counts near the traffic light.

2. **Prediction**:
   - A Linear Regression model is trained during the simulation.
   - The model predicts future vehicle counts for a specified time step.

3. **Actuation**:
   - The traffic light state (`RED` or `GREEN`) is updated dynamically based on predictions.
   - Example Rule: Turn `GREEN` if the predicted vehicle count exceeds 5.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Real-time, interactive visualization of:
     - Vehicle positions on the road.
     - Traffic light state.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Prediction Models**:
   - Replace Linear Regression with time-series models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTMs) for better accuracy.

2. **Multi-Lane and Multi-Light Simulation**:
   - Simulate multiple lanes and intersections with coordinated traffic lights.

3. **Dynamic Vehicle Behavior**:
   - Introduce lane-switching, acceleration/deceleration profiles, and stop-and-go patterns.

4. **Complex Road Networks**:
   - Extend to a grid-like road network with directional movement.
